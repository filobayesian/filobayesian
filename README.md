## 🪽 About me
- 3rd year Econ @ Bocconi
- Currently exploring Extreme Value Theory

## 🥼 Research Oriented Projects

With [⁠ Braico ⁠](https://github.com/francescobraicovich) and [ Vitto ](https://github.com/garavels) we explored *ARC–AGI with Reinforcement Learning*:

- [⁠ ARC (v1) ⁠](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/ARC): Custom DSL and action space with Wolpertinger Actor-Critic for large combinatorial domains.
- [⁠ ARC (v2) ⁠](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/ARC2): Added learnable action embeddings and ViT state encoding with a pretrained world model.
- [⁠ ARC (v3) ⁠](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/ARC3): World modeling.

Under the CS department @ Bocconi we are working on:
- ['RL World Models'](https://github.com/bocconi-narcos/latent-world-models): Benchmarking JEPA vs. ViT encoder–decoder world models in RL environments.

## 🌐 University Projects
- [⁠ Statistics-30457 ⁠](https://github.com/garavels/Statistics-30457): Vanilla risk parity vs. alternative model portfolios. 
- [⁠ Econometrics-30462 ⁠](https://github.com/filobayesian/Econometrics-30462): Demand modeling using cross-sectional and panel techniques. 


## 💭 Personal Projects
- [⁠ Weather Derivatives ⁠](https://github.com/GianiRanzetti/Minerva---Weather-Derivatives): Climate modeling with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes using Wavelet Networks. 

## ❕ Current Interests
- Building InkRL with [ Vitto ](https://github.com/garavels) and [ Andre ](https://github.com/WaverAndrew).
- Exploring Exepctiles with EVT in time series for my thesis.
