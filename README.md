## 🥼 Research Oriented Projects

With [⁠ Braico ⁠](https://github.com/francescobraicovich) and [ Vitto ](https://github.com/garavels) we explored *ARC–AGI with Reinforcement Learning*: \\
•⁠  ⁠[⁠ ARC (v1) ⁠](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/ARC): Custom DSL and action space with Wolpertinger Actor-Critic for large combinatorial domains. \\
•⁠  ⁠[⁠ ARC (v2) ⁠](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/ARC2): Added learnable action embeddings and ViT state encoding with a pretrained world model. \\
•⁠  ⁠[⁠ ARC (v3) ⁠](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/ARC3): World modeling. \\

Under the CS department @ Bocconi we are working on: \\
•⁠  ⁠['RL World Models'](https://github.com/bocconi-narcos/latent-world-models): Benchmarking JEPA vs. ViT encoder–decoder world models in RL environments.

## 🌐 University Projects
 [⁠ Statistics-30457 ⁠](https://github.com/garavels/Statistics-30457): Vanilla risk parity vs. alternative model portfolios. \\
 [⁠ Econometrics-30462 ⁠](https://github.com/filobayesian/Econometrics-30462): Demand modeling using cross-sectional and panel techniques. \\


## 💭 Personal Projects
 [⁠ Weather Derivatives ⁠](https://github.com/GianiRanzetti/Minerva---Weather-Derivatives): Climate modeling with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes using Wavelet Networks. \\
